# macdev

This is a long-overdue attempt at starting to capture my mac development setup.
There's not much in here yet, but I hope to progressively capture a little more
over time.

Probably mostly useful to me, but feel free to use/abuse as you see fit - however,
please note that I accept no responsibility for your usage of this code.
